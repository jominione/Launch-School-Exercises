# Using the multiply function from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" exercise,
# write a function that computes the square of its argument (the square
# is the result of multiplying a number by itself).

# Solution:

def square(n):
    def multiply(num1, num2):
        return num1 * num2
    return multiply(n, n)

# Examples:

print(square(5) == 25)
print(square(-8) == 64)
