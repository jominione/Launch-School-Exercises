# Build a program that displays when the user will retire and how many years
# she has to work till retirement.

# Solution:

age = input('What is your age today? ')
retirement = input('At what age would you like to retire? ')
print()

print(f"It's 2024. You will retire in {2024 + int(retirement) - int(age)}.")
print(f'You have only {int(retirement) - int(age)} years of work to go!')


# Example

# What is your age today? 30
# At what age would you like to retire? 70

# It's 2024. You will retire in 2064.
# You have only 40 years of work to go!
