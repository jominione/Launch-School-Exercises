# Example 1
# Please enter an integer greater than 0: 5
# Enter "s" to compute the sum, or "p" to compute the product. s
#
# The sum of the integers between 1 and 5 is 15.

# Example 2
# Please enter an integer greater than 0: 5
# Enter "s" to compute the sum, or "p" to compute the product. p
#
# The product of the integers between 1 and 6 is 720.
