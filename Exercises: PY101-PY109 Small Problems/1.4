# Build a program that asks the user to enter the length and width of a
# room, in meters, then prints the room's area in both square meters and
# square feet.
# Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

# Solution:

def prompt(message):
    print(f"==> {message}")

prompt("What is the length of the room in meters?")
length = input()

width = prompt("What is the width of the room in meters?")
width = input()

area_meter = int(length) * int(width)
area_feet = area_meter * 10.7639


# Examples:

print(f"The room's area is {area_meter}m^2.")
print(f"The room's area is {area_feet}ft^2.")
