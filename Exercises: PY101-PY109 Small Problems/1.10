# Write a function that computes the sum of all numbers between 1 and some
# other numbers, inclusive, that are multiples of 3 or 5. For instance, 
# if the supplied number is 20, the result should be 98 (3 + 5 + 6 + 9 +
# 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20).

# You may assume that the number in is an integer greater than 1.

# Solution:

def multisum(int):
    multiples = []
    sum = 0
    for num in range(1, int+1):
        if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:
            multiples.append(num)
    for num in multiples:
        sum += num
    return sum

# Examples:
# These examples should all print True

print(multisum(3) == 3)
print(multisum(5) == 8)
print(multisum(10) == 33)
print(multisum(1000) == 234168)
