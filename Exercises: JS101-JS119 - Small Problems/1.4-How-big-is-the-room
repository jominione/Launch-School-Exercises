// Build a program that asks the user to enter the length and width of a room 
// in meters, and then logs the area of the room to the console in both square 
// meters and square feet.

// Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

// Do not worry about validating the input at this time. Use the 
// readlineSync.prompt method to collect user input.

// Example:

// Enter the length of the room in meters:
// 10
// Enter the width of the room in meters:
// 7
// The area of the room is 70.00 square meters (753.47 square feet).

// Solution:

let readlineSync = require('readline-sync');
let length = readlineSync.question('Enter the length of the room in meters:\n');
let width = readlineSync.question('Enter the width of the room in meters:\n');
console.log(`The area of the room is ${(length * width).toFixed(2)} square ` + 
            `meters (${(length * width * 10.7639).toFixed(2)} square feet).`);
