// Build a program that logs when the user will retire and how many more years 
// the user has to work until retirement.

// Example:

let readLineSync = require('readline-sync');
let age = parseInt(readLineSync.question('What is your age? '));
let retireAge = parseInt(readLineSync.question('At what age would you ' +
                                               'like to retire? '));
console.log(`It's 2017. You will retire in ${2017 + retireAge - age}.`);
console.log(`You only have ${retireAge - age} years of work to go!`);
