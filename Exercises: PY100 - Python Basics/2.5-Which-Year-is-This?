# The Python documentation for the datetime module provides two attributes
# to retrieve the year from a date or datetime object: year and isocalendar.

from datetime import date

today = date.today()

today_year = today.year
iso_year = today.isocalendar()

# What is the difference between the year attribute and the isocalendar
# method?

# Solution: The year attribute of a date or datetime object simply returns
# the year of that date.

# The isocalendar method returns a tuple containing three values: the ISO
# year, ISO week number, and ISO weekday. The ISO year (isoclaendar()[0])
# may differ from the Gregorian calendar year (year) for dates close to
# the start or end of the year, because the ISO year starts with the first week
# that has at least 4 days in the new year.

# In most common scenarios, you'd want to use the year attribute. The
# isocalendar would be more relevant if you're working with ISO week dates.
