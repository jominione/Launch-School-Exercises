# Determine what the following code snippet prints. First solve it in your
# head or on paper, then run it in your Python environment to check the result.

# Solution:

speed = 0
acceleration = 24
braking_force = 19
is_moving = breaking_force < acceleration and (speed > 0 or acceleration > 0)
print(is_moving)        # True

# Bonus question: Do we need the parentheses in the boolean expression or
# could we have written the following?:

is_moving = breaking_force < acceleration and speed > 0 or acceleration > 0

# Solution: Precedent of evaluating boolean statements is to start left
# to right so you evaluate and then or. Here the output changes to False.
