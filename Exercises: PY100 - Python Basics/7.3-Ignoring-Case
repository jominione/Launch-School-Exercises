# Using the following case, compare the value of name with the string 'RoGer'
# while ignoring the case of both strings. Print true if the values are
# the same; print false if they aren't. Next, perform a case-insensitive
# comparison between the value of name and the string 'DAVE'.

# Solution:

name = 'Roger'

print(name.casefold() == 'RoGer'.casefold())

print(name.casefold() == 'DAVE'.casefold())
