# What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried
# to answer.

# Example:

print(greeting)

greeting = 'Hello world!'

# Solution: Raise NameError. print references variable greeting that is not
# defined when print is executed so will raise NameError.

# Official Solution: In Python, you must intialise a variable before you use
# it; otherwise, it raises a NameError indicating the name hasn't been defined.
