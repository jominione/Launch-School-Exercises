# What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried
# to answer.

a = 1

def my_function():
    global a
    a = 2

my_function()
print(a)

# Solution: 2.

# a is initialised at the global level with value of 1. In my_function
# the global keyword tells the function to assume that a refers to the global
# variable a. This means any operation variable inside this function will
# affect the global variable a, not a local one.

# Once my_function is invoked this reassigns the global variable and value
# of global a has changed to 2 and prints value 2.
