# The following code raises a TypeError:

tweet = 'Woohoo! :-)'

if len(tweet) > 140:
    print('Tweet is too long!')

length_of_tweet = len(tweet + 5)

# What does a TypeError indicate? Try running the above code, then use the
# the resulting error message to determine exactly what is wrong. (You don't
# have to fix this code).

# Solution: TypeError is raised when the argument for an input is not of
# type that is excepted by that function.
