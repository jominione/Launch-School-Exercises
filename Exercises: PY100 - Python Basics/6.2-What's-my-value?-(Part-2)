# What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried
# to answer.

x = 10

def my_function():
    x = x + 5
    print(x)

my_function()

# Solution: It will raise an UnboundLocalError.

# In the function my_function, when we attempt to reassign the
# value of x by incrementing it, Python assumes that x is a local variable
# since we're assigning it inside the function. However, since it is 
# uninitialised, we get an error. If we wanted to modify the global x, we
# would need to use the global keyword.
