# What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried
# to answer.

# Example:

x = 10

def my_function():
    x = x + 5
    print(x)

my_function()

# Solution: Will raise UnboundLocalError. Python assumes the x value is 
# different to x defined at line 6. my_function references x within its scope 
# but when print function is invoked the local x is not defined. x is assigned 
# value x + 5 but x is not initialised with a value within scope of the 
# function.

# Official Solution: In the my_function, when we attempt to reassign the
# value of x by incrementing it, Python assumes that x is a local variable
# since we're assigning it inside the function. However, since it is 
# uninitialised, we get an error. If we wanted to modify the global x, we
# would need to use the global keyword.
