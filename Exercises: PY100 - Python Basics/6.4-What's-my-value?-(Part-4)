# What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried
# to answer.

a = 1

def my_function():
    print(a)

my_function()

# Solution: 1. Since a is initialised at the top level of our code this
# makes it globally accessible throughtout the code, including within the
# body of the my_function. When we invoke my_function, it prints the value
# of the global variable a, which is 1.
