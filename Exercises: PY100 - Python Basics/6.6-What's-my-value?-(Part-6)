# What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried
# to answer.

a = 1

def my_function():
    a = 2

my_function()
print(a)

# Solution: 1.

# When my_function is invoked it detects that a is initialised to 2 but 
# this is only accessible locally. It completes the block of code returning 
# None.

# When print(a) is invoked it accesses variable a initialised at the global
# level printing the value 1.
