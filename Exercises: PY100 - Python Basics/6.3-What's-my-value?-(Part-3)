# What will the followign code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried
# to answer.

# Example:

def my_function():
    a = 1

    if True:
        print(a)

my_function()

# Solution: Output 1. a is initiliased within local scope of my_function.
# When my_function is invoked the if condition is true so will invoke print
# which references a that is initialised at line 7.

# Official Solution: Variables initiliased in the same scope where a block
# begins can be accessed inside the block. In our case, the variable a is
# initialised within the function my_function and then accessed inside the
# if statement block. Therefore, the print(a) statement on line 5 outputs
# the value 1 when my_function is invoked.
