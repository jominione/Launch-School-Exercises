def my_function():
    a = 1

    if True:
        print(a)

my_function()

# Solution: 1. When my_function is invoked it will print a which is initialised
# inside the my_function and has a local scope.

# Variables initialised in the same scope where a block begins can be accessed
# inside the block. In our case, the variable a is initialised within the
# function my_function and then accessed inside the if statement block.
# Therefore, the print(a) statement on line 5 outputs the value 1 when
# my_function is invoked.
