# You want to add the numbers from 1 to 5 to a list, but the code below
# is not producing the expected result. How can you fix it?

# numbers = []
# 
# for i in range(5):
#     numbers.append(i)
# 
# print(numbers)

# Solution: range function default starts from 0. To start from 1 you need
# to explicitly add argument 1 and 6 (as goes up to but does not include
# 6).

numbers = []

for i in range(1, 6):
    numbers.append(i)

print(numbers)
