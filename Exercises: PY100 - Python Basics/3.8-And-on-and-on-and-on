# The following code keeps looping forever. (You can hit Ctrl-C to stop it.)
# Why does the loop keep running? Modify it so that it stops after the first
# iteration.

# Solution: The condition True always applies therefore turning the while
# statement into infinite loop.

while True:
    print("and on")
    break
