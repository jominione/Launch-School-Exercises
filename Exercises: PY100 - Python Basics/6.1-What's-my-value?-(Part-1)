# What will the following code do and why? Don't run it until you have tried
# to answer.

if True:
    my_value = 20

print(my_value)

# Solution: 20.

# In Python, variables initialised inside a block are accessible outside
# of that block. Thus, the variable my_value initialised inside the if blcock
# on line 5 can be accssed and printed on line 7.
