// Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, 
// then asks if the user wants to determine the sum or the product of all 
// numbers between 1 and the entered integer, inclusive.

// Examples:

// Please enter an integer greater than 0: 5
// Enter "s" to compute the sum, or "p" to compute the product. s

// The sum of the integers between 1 and 5 is 15.

// Please enter an integer greater than 0: 6
// Enter "s" to compute the sum, or "p" to compute the product. p

// The product of the integers between 1 and 6 is 720.

// Solution:

let readlineSync = require('readline-sync');
let integer = parseInt(readlineSync.question('Please enter an integer ' +
                                             'greater than 0: '));
let operator = readlineSync.question('Enter "s" to compute the sum, or "p" ' +
                                     'to compute the product. ');
console.log();

if (operator === 's') {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = integer; i > 0; i--) {
    sum += i;
  }
  console.log(`The sum of the integers between 1 and ${integer} is ${sum}.`);
} else {
  let product = 1;
  for (let i = integer; i > 0; i--) {
    product *= i;
  }
  console.log(`The product of the integers beetween 1 and ${integer} is ${product}.`)
