// Build a program that asks the user to enter the length and width of a room 
// in meters, and then logs the area of the room to the console in both square 
// meters and square feet.

// Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

// Do not worry about validating the input at this time. Use the 
// readlineSync.prompt method to collect user input.

// Example:

// Enter the length of the room in meters:
// 10
// Enter the width of the room in meters:
// 7
// The area of the room is 70.00 square meters (753.47 square feet).

// Solution:

let readlineSync = require('readline-sync');

const SQMETERS_TO_SQFEET = 10.7639;

console.log('Enter the length of the room in meters:');
let length = readlineSync.prompt();
length = parseInt(length, 10);

console.log('Enter the width of the room in meters:');
let width = readlineSync.prompt();
width = parseInt(width, 10);

let areaInMeters = length * width;
let areaInFeet = areaInMeters * SQMETERS_TO_SQFEET;

console.log(`The area of the room is ${areaInMeters.toFixed(2)} square meters` + 
            ` (${areaInFeet.toFixed(2)} square feet).`);
