// In this exercise, you will write a program that asks the user for a phrase, 
// then outputs the number of characters in that phrase. Go over the 
// documentation for String to find an appropriate method to use.

// Examples:

// Please enter a phrase: walk
// console output
// There are 4 characters in "walk".

// Please enter a phrase: walk, don't run
// console output
// There are 15 characters in "walk, don't run".

// Solution:

let readlineSync = require("readline-sync");
let phrase = readlineSync.question("Please enter a phrase: ");
console.log(`There are ${phrase.length} characters in "${phrase}".`);
