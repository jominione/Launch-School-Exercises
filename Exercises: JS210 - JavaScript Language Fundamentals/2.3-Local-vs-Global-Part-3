// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the 
// code until after you have tried to answer.

var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  myVar = 'This is local';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);

// Solution: Will output 'This is local'. 

// The variable myVar is a global variable and accessible within the 
// someFunction function scope. Within someFunction myVar is reassigned the
// value 'This is local'.

// When someFunction is invoked, it reassigns a new string to the global myVar.
// This is possible because variables in the global scope can be accessed
// and modified from within an inner scope.
