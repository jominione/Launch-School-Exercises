// The following program is expected to log each number between 0 and 9 
// (inclusive) that is a multiple of 3. Read through the code shown below. 
// Will it produce the expected result? Why or why not?

let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log(i);
  } else {
    i += 1;
  }
}

// No it will not iteratively log 0 to 9 because the conditional loop never
// satisifies the loop condition that will increment i so you end up having
// an infinite loop of log 0.
