// A user wrote a function that takes an array as an argument and returns 
// its average. Given the code below, the user expects the average function 
// to return 5. Is the user's expectation correct? Why or why not?

const myArray = [5, 5];
myArray[-1] = 5;
myArray[-2] = 5;

function average(array) {
  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = -2; i < array.length; i += 1) {
    sum += array[i];
  }

  return sum / array.length;
}

average(myArray);

// Solution: The user is incorrect. The console will output 10.

// Discussion: An array property with a key of anything other than a
// non-negative integer is not counted as part of the array's length.

// Therefore in the code above, array.length = 2, instead of 4 like the user
// expected. So the expression in the return evaluates to 20 /2 and the
// function returns 10.
