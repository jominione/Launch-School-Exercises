// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

console.log(greeting);

let greeting = 'Hello world!';

// Solution: Will raise a ReferenceError because greeting is not initialised
// when it is called by console.log.

// In contrast to var variables, let variables are not accessible before they 
// are declared. For that reason the above code raises an error.
