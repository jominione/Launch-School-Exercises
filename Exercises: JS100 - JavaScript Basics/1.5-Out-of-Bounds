// What happens if we take the array ['fish', 'and', 'chips'] and try to
// access the element at position 10? Try this in your JavaScript console.

// Solution: Attempting to access an element at an index that is out of the 
// bounds of the array will return undefined.

console.log(['fish', 'and', 'chips'][10]);  // => undefined.
