// In your JavaScript console, execute the following two lines of code to
// check whether their values differ and if so, how. Take a look at the MDN
// documentation on equality comparisons to read about how == and === differ.

// Solution:

console.log('8' == 8);  // => true
console.log('8' === 8); // => false
