// Predict the output of the following code:

if (false || true) {
  console.log('Yes!');
} else {
  console.log('No...');
}

// Solution: Log 'Yes!' because if condition will always resolve to true.

// The condition provided to our if statement uses the logical or operator 
// ||. Therefore the condition will evaluate to a truthy value if either one 
// of its operands is truthy. Since true is truthy, the condition will always 
// be truthy as well.
