// How can you check whether a variable holds a value that is an array? For 
// example, imagine you start writing a function and want to check whether 
// its argument is an array:

// Solution:

function filter(input) {
  Array.isArray(input);
}

// Note that the typeof operator returns 'object' for arrays, because arrays 
// are objects. Therefore it does not distinguish between arrays and other 
// objects.
