// The MDN page for Date lists two methods to get the year of a date.

let today = new Date();

console.log(today.getYear());
console.log(today.getFullYear());

// What is the difference between the two methods and which one should you
// use?

// Solution: 

// .getYear() returns an integer representing the year for the given date 
// according to local time, minus 1900. Is deprecated.

// .getFullYear() Returns an integer representing the year for the given date 
// according to local time
