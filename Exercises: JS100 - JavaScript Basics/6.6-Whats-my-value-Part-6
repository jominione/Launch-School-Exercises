// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

// Example:

let a = 5;
let b = false;

if (a > 4) {
  let b = true;
}

console.log(b);

// Solution: Will log false. Since variables declared with let inside block are 
// not available in outer scope. JavaScript will look for b in the global
// scope.

// The situation is similar to that of the previous exercise: The variable 
// b declared on line 2 and the variable b declared on line 5 in the body 
// of the if statement have the same name, but they are two different 
// variables. Important to note is that the b that we reference on line 8 
// refers to the variable declared on line 2. This is because the scope of 
// b declared on line 5 is the body of the if statement, and it is not 
// accessible in any outer scope.
