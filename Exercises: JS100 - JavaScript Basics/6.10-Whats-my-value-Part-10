// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

// Example:

const a = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe'
};

function myFunction() {
  a.firstName = 'Jane';
}

myFunction();

console.log(a);

// Solution: Will log a.firstName => 'Jane'.

// The fact that const variables cannot be re-assigned does not mean that 
// the value they hold is immutable. As we see in the example above, objects 
// that are assigned to const variables can be mutated.
