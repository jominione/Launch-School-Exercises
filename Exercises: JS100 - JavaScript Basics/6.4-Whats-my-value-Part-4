// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

// Example:

function myFunction() {
  let a = 1;

  if (true) {
    console.log(a);
  }
}

myFunction();

// Solution: Will log 1. Variable is initialised with let inside block. If 
// condition is true and block statement is executed.

// Variables declared in an outer scope can be accessed in any inner scope. 
// In our case, the variable a is declared in the function definition and 
// then accessed in the body of the if statement. For that reason, line 4 
// logs the value 1 when myFunction is invoked.
