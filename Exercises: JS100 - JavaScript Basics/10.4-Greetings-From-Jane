// 'Hey, Bobby!' to the console.

  age: 32,
  location: {
    country: 'Denmark',

// A property value can be any valid expression, including a function 
// expression. When the value is a function and it is invoked with an explicit 
// caller, as seen on line 13 of the original code, it is called method 
// invocation. You will continue to learn much more about this in future 
// lessons.
