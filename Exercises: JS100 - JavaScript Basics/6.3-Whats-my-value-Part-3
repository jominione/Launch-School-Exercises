// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

// Example:

if (true) {
  let myValue = 20;
}

console.log(myValue);

// Solution:

// Will raise a ReferencError because myValue when initialised in the block
// it has block scope and not visible outside of the block. So when console.log
// calls myValue it looks for its value in global space but it has not been
// initialised yet.

// Variables declared with let are block scoped. This means that when we 
// declare the variable myValue within a block on line 2, that variable is 
// not accessible outside of the block on line 5, and a ReferenceError is 
// raised.
