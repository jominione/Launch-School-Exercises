// Predict the output of the following code:

if (true && false) {
  console.log('Yes!');
} else {
  console.log('No...');
}

// Solution: Will always log 'No...' since if condition will always resolve to
// false.

// The condition provided to our if statement uses the logical and operator 
// &&. Therefore the condition will return a truthy value only if both of 
// its operands are truthy. Since false is not truthy, neither will be our 
// condition.
