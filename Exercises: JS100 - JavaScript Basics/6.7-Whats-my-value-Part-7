// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it 
// until you have tried to answer.

// Example:

let a = 1;

function myFunction() {
  console.log(a);
}

myFunction();

// Solution: Will log 1. Variables declared in the outer scope are accessible
// in the inner scope. So when myFunction() is invoked the reference of a 
// logs the value 1.

// The variable a declared in the let statement on line 1 is declared at the 
// very top level of our code, so it is accessible from everywhere in the code, 
// including from within the body of myFunction.
