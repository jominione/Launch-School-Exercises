# Given two lists, convert them to sets and return a new set which is the
# union of both sets.

# Solution:

def merge_sets(list1, list2):
    result = set(list1 + list2)
    return result

list1 = [3, 5, 7, 9]
list2 = [5, 7, 11, 13]
print(merge_sets(list1, list2) == {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13})
# Prints True
