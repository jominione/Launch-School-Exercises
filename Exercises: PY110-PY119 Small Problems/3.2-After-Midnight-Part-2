# As seen in the previous exercise, the time of day can be represented as
# the number of minutes before or after midnight. If the number of minutes
# is positive, the time is after midnight. If the number of minutes is 
# negative, the time is before midnight.

# Write two functions that each take a time of day in 24 hour format, and
# return the number of minutes before and after midnight, respectively. Both
# functions should return a value in the range of 0 through 1439.

# You may not use Python's datetime module.

# Disregard Daylight Savings and Standard Time and other irregularities.

# Solution:

def after_midnight(time):
    if time == "24:00":
        hours = 0
    else:
        hours = int(time[0:2]) * 60
    minutes = int(time[3:5])
    result = hours + minutes
    return result

def before_midnight(time):
    if time == "00:00":
        hours = 24 * 60
    else:
        hours = int(time[0:2]) * 60
    minutes = int(time[3:5])
    result = 24 * 60 - (hours + minutes)
    return result

# Examples:

print(after_midnight("00:00") == 0)     # True
print(before_midnight("00:00") == 0)    # True
print(after_midnight("12:34") == 754)   # True
print(before_midnight("12:34") == 686)  # True
print(after_midnight("24:00") == 0)     # True
print(before_midnight("24:00") == 0)    # True
