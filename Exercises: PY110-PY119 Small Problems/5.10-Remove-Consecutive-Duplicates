# Given a sequence of integers, filter out instances where the same value
# occurs successively, retaining only the initial occurrence. Return the
# refined sequence.

# Solution:

def unique_sequence(numbers):

    result = []
    for index in range(len(numbers)-1):
        if numbers[index] != numbers[index+1]:
            result.append(numbers[index])
   
    result.append(numbers[-1])

    return result

# Example:

original = [1, 1, 2, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 4]
expected = [1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 4]
print(unique_sequence(original) == expected)      # True
