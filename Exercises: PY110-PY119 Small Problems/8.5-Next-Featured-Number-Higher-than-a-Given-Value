# A featured number (something unique to this exercise) is an odd number
# that is a multiple of 7, with all of its digits occurring exactly once
# each. For example, 49 is a featured number, but 98 is not (it is not odd),
# 97 is not (it is not a multiple of 7), and 133 is not (the digit 3 appears
# twice).

# Write a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns the next
# featured number greater than the integer. Issue an error message if there
# is no next featured number.

# Solution:

def is_featured(number):
    error = "There is no possible number that fulfills those requirements."
    
    while number:
        number += 1
        if (number % 2 == 1) and (number % 7 == 0) and \
        (len(str(number)) == len(set(str(number)))):
            return number
        elif number > 9876543201:
            return error

# Examples:

print(is_featured(12) == 21)                  # True
print(is_featured(20) == 21)                  # True
print(is_featured(21) == 35)                  # True
print(is_featured(997) == 1029)               # True
print(is_featured(1029) == 1043)              # True
print(is_featured(999999) == 1023547)         # True
print(is_featured(999999987) == 1023456987)   # True
print(is_featured(9876543186) == 9876543201)  # True
print(is_featured(9876543200) == 9876543201)  # True

error = ("There is no possible number that "
         "fulfills those requirements.")
print(is_featured(9876543201) == error)       # True
