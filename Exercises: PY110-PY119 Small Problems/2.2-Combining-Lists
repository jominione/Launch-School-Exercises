# Write a function that takes two lists as arguments and returns a set that
# contains the union of the values from the two lists. You may assume that
# both arguments will always be lists.

# Solution:

def union(lst1, lst2):
    union_set = set(lst1 + lst2)
    return union_set

# Example:

print(union([1, 3, 5], [3, 6, 9]) == {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}) # True
