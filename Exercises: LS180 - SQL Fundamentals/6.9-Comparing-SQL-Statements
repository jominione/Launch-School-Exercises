-- In this exercise, we'll use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to compare the efficiency of 
-- two SQL statements. These two statements are actually from the "Query From 
-- a Virtual Table" exercise in this set. In that exercise, we stated that 
-- our subquery-based solution:

-- SELECT MAX(bid_counts.count) FROM
--   (SELECT COUNT(bidder_id) FROM bids GROUP BY bidder_id) AS bid_counts;

-- was actually faster than the simpler equivalent without subqueries:

-- SELECT COUNT(bidder_id) AS max_bid FROM bids
--   GROUP BY bidder_id
--   ORDER BY max_bid DESC
--   LIMIT 1;

-- In this exercise, we will demonstrate this fact.

-- Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on the two statements above. Compare the planning time, 
-- execution time, and the total time required to run these two statements. 
-- Also compare the total "costs". Which statement is more efficient and why?
