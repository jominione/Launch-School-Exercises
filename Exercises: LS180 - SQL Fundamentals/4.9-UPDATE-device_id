-- We've realized that the last two parts we're using for device number 2, 
-- "Gyroscope", actually belong to an "Accelerometer". Write an SQL statement 
-- that will associate the last two parts from our parts table with an 
-- "Accelerometer" instead of a "Gyroscope".

-- Solution:

UPDATE parts SET device_id = 1 WHERE part_number = 10 OR part_number = 11;
