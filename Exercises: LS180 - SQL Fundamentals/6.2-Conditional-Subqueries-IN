-- Write a SQL query that shows all items that have had bids put on them. 
-- Use the logical operator IN for this exercise, as well as a subquery.

-- Here is the expected output:


--  Bid on Items
-- ---------------
--  Video Game
--  Outdoor Grill
--  Painting
--  Tent
--  Vase
-- (5 rows)

-- Approach/Algorithm:

-- This assignment on subqueries should be of use for this exercise. This 
-- section on subqueries in the PostgreSQL documentation should be helpful 
-- as well.

-- The output for this exercise should also have an alias in place for the 
-- column we need to select.

-- Solution:

SELECT items.name AS "Bid on Items"
FROM items
WHERE items.id IN (SELECT DISTINCT item_id FROM bids);
