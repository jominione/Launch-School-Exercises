-- Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

CREATE SEQUENCE part_number_sequence;

-- Solution [Wrong]: Neither. The command is not syntapically correct.

-- DDL. CREATE SEQUENCE statements modify the characteristics and attributes
-- of a database by adding a sequence object to the database structure. It
-- does not actually manipulate any data, but isntead manipulates the data
-- definitions. As such, CREATE SEQUENCE statements are part of the DDL 
-- sublanguage.

-- It could also be argued that CREATE SEQUENCE is DML; the sequence object
-- it creates is a bit of data that is used to keep track of a sequence of
-- automatically generated values, so it can be thought of as being part of
-- the data isntead of a chracteristic of the data. However, all CREATE 
-- statements (not just CREATE SEQUENCE) are generally thought of as DDL.
