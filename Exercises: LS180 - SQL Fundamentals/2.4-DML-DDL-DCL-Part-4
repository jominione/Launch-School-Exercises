-- Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

ALTER TABLE things
DROP CONSTRAINT things_item_key;

-- Solution: DDL. ALTER TABLE and DROP CONSTRAINT alters the data structure
-- of the SQL statement and does not change the contents or data of the table
-- itself so it is DDL.

-- ALTER TABLE modifies the characteristics and attributes of a table. It
-- does not actually manipulate any data definitions. As such, ALTER TABLE
-- statements are part of the DDL sublanguage.
