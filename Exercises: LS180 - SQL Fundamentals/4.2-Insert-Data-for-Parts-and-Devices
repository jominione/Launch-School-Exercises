-- Now that we have the infrastructure for our workshop set up, let's start 
-- adding in some data. Add in two different devices. One should be named, 
-- "Accelerometer". The other should be named, "Gyroscope".

-- The first device should have 3 parts (this is grossly simplified). The 
-- second device should have 5 parts. The part numbers may be any number 
-- between 1 and 10000. There should also be 3 parts that don't belong to 
-- any device yet.

-- Solution:

INSERT INTO devices (name)
VALUES ('Accelerometer'), ('Gyroscope');


INSERT INTO parts (part_number, device_id) 
VALUES (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1),
       (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (10, 2), (11, 2)
       (7, null), (8, null), (9, null);
