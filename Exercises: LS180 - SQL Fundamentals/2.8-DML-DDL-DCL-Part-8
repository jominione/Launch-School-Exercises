-- Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

DELETE FROM things WHERE item = 'Cup';

-- Solution: DML. DELETE deletes rows of data from the things table and such
-- is part of DML sublanguage.

-- DELETE statements delete specific rows of data in a database. Therefore,
-- it is part of the DMBL sublanguage since it manipulates the data and not
-- the structure of the data.
