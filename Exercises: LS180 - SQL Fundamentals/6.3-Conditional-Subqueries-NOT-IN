-- Write a SQL query that shows all items that have not had bids put on them. 
-- Use the logical operator NOT IN for this exercise, as well as a subquery.

-- Here is the expected output:

--  Not Bid On
-- ------------
--  Television
-- (1 row)

-- Approach/Algorithm:

-- This assignment on subqueries should be of use for this exercise. This 
-- section on subqueries in the PostgreSQL documentation should be helpful 
-- as well.

-- The output for this exercise should also have an alias in place for the 
-- column we need to select.

-- Solution:

SELECT items.name AS "Not Bid On"
FROM items
WHERE items.id NOT IN (SELECT item_id FROM bids);
