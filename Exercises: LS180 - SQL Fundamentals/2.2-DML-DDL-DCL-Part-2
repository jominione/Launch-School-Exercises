-- Does the following statement use the Data Definition Language (DDL) or
-- the Data Manipulation Language (DML) component of SQL?

-- SELECT column_name FROM my_table;

-- Solution: It uses DML. SELECT merely queries (reads) the data in a database.
-- Since it manipulates the data and not the structure of the data, SELECT is
-- part of the DML sublanguage.
