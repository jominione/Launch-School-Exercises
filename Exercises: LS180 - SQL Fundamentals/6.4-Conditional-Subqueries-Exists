-- Write a SELECT query that returns a list of names of everyone who has bid 
-- in the auction. While it is possible (and perhaps easier) to do this with 
-- a JOIN clause, we're going to do things differently: use a subquery with 
-- the EXISTS clause instead. Here is the expected output:

--       name
-- -----------------
--  Alison Walker
--  James Quinn
--  Taylor Williams
--  Alexis Jones
--  Gwen Miller
--  Alan Parker
-- (6 rows)

-- Approach/Algorithms:

-- This assignment on subqueries should be of use for this exercise. This 
-- section on subqueries in the PostgreSQL documentation should be helpful 
-- as well.

-- Solution:

SELECT name
FROM bidders
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bids WHERE bids.bidder_id = bidders.id);
