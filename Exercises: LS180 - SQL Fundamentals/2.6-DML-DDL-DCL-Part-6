-- Does the following statement use the DDL or DML component of SQL?

UPDATE things
SET material = 'plastic'
WHERE item = 'Cup';

-- Solution: DML. UPDATE changes the value in rows therefore it is part
-- of the DML sub-language since it modifies the data and not the structure
-- of the data.

-- UPDATE modifies specific rows of data in a database. Therefore, it is part
-- of the DML sublanguage since it manipulates the data and not the structure
-- of the data.
