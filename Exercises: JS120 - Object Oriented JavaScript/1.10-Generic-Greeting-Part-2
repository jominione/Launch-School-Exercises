// Using the following code, add two methods: static method genericGreeting 
// and instance method personalGreeting. The first method should log a greeting 
// that's generic to the class. The second method should be an instance method 
// and log a greeting that's custom to the object.

// Expected output:

// Hello! I'm a cat!
// Hello! My name is Sophie!

// Solution:

class Cat {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  static genericGreeting() {
    console.log("Hello! I'm a cat!");
  }

  personalGreeting() {
    console.log(`Hello! My name is ${this.name}!`);
  }

}

let kitty = new Cat("Sophie");
Cat.genericGreeting();
kitty.personalGreeting();

// Discussion:

// The most notable difference between static and instance methods is that
// static methods are called on a class (constructor function), not any
// instance of the class. Think of static methods as generic actions a class
// may perform.
