// Using the code from the previous exercise, move the greeting from the 
// constructor method to an instance method named greet that logs a greeting 
// to the console when invoked.

// Solution:

class Cat {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello! My name is ${this.name}!`);
  }
}

let kitty = new Cat('Sophie');
kitty.greet();

// Discussion:

// Instance methods are only available when there's an instance of the class.
// For example, kitty is an instance of the Cat class. This means, if we add
// the greet method, we're able to invoke it.

// As mentioned in the previous exercse, the property name can be accessed
// anywhere within the class using this keyword. This lets us print 'Hello!
// My name is Sophie!' from greet simply by moving the statement from
// constructor to greet.
