// Using the code from the previous exercise, create an instance of Cat and
// assign it to a variable named kitty.

class Cat {

}

// Solution:

let kitty = new Cat();

// Discussion:

// To instantiate a new Cat object, we use the keyword new in front of the
// function call. This keyword turns the function call into a constructor
// call.

// To make use of this new Cat object, we need to assign it to a variable.
// In the solution, we assign the object to a variable named kitty.
