// Given the following code, modify the Truck class so that the code shown 
// below displays the indicated output. Your code should make use of the 
// startEngine method in the Vehicle class.

// Expected Output:

// Ready to go! Drive fast, please!
// Ready to go! Drive slow, please!

// Solution:

class Vehicle {
  startEngine() {
    return 'Ready to go!';
  }
}

class Truck extends Vehicle {
  startEngine(speed) {
    return super.startEngine() + ` Drive ${speed}, please!`;
  }
}

let truck1 = new Truck();
console.log(truck1.startEngine('fast'));

let truck2 = new Truck();
console.log(truck2.startEngine('slow'));

// Discussion:

// Here we are using the super keyword to call function on the object's parent.
// This way we are able to use some function functionality from the parent
// class Vehicle in the Truck class.
