// Consider the following program.

// Update this code so that when you run it, you see the following output:

// Expected output:

// My cat Pudding is 7 years old and has black and white fur.
// My cat Butterscotch is 10 years old and has tan and white fur.

// Solution:

class Pet {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

class Cat extends Pet {
  constructor(name, age, colour) {
    super(name, age);
    this.colour = colour;
  }

  info() {
    return `My cat ${this.name} is ${this.age} years old and has ${this.colour} fur.`
  }
}

let pudding = new Cat('Pudding', 7, 'black and white');
let butterscotch = new Cat('Butterscotch', 10, 'tan and white');

console.log(pudding.info());
console.log(butterscotch.info());

// Discussion:

// Since constructor method in Cat class requires arguments that differ from
// constructor method in Pet class, we must define a constructor method for
// Cat, and that method must be sure to call super.

// Finally, we just need to define info method on Cat class that returns
// required message.
