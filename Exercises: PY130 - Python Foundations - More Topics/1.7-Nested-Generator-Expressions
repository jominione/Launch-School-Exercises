# Use nested generated expressions to create a flat list of numbers from a
# list of lists.

# Solution:

# Outer list (list of lists with some None values)
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],    # Inner list 1
    [4, None, 6], # Inner list 2
    [7, 8, None]  # Inner list 3
]

flattened = list((x for inner in matrix for x in inner if x is not None))

print(flattened)
