# Create a function concatenate that takes any number of strings and 
# concatenates them into a single string with a space in between.

# Solution:

def concatenate(*args):
    strings = []
    for string in args:
        strings.append(string)
    return ' '.join(strings)


# Examples:

print(concatenate("Launch", "School", "is", "great")) # Launch School is great
print(concatenate("I", "am", "working", "on", "the", "PY130", "course")) 
# I am working on the PY130 course
