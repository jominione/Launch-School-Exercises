# Create a class named Cat that prints a greeting when the greet instance
# method is invoked. The greeting should include the name and colour of the
# cat. use a class constant to define the colour.

# Solution:

class Cat:

    COLOUR = 'purple'

    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello! My name is {self._name} and I'm a {Cat.COLOUR} cat!")

kitty = Cat('Sophie')
kitty.greet()
