# Using the code from the previous exercise, move the greeting from the 
# __init__ method to an isntance method named greet that prints a greeting
# when invoked. Make sure you write some code that invokes the method.

# Solution:

class Cat:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello! My name is {self.name}!")

kitty = Cat('Sophie')
kitty.greet()
