# Given the following code, modify Truck.start_engine by appending 
# 'Drive fast, please!' to the return value of Vehicle.start_engine. The
# 'fast' in 'Drive fast, please!' should be taken from the value of the speed
# argument.

# Solution:

class Vehicle:
    def start_engine(self):
        return 'Ready to go!'

class Truck(Vehicle):

    def start_engine(self, speed):
        self._speed = speed
        prepand = super().start_engine()
        return f"{prepand} Drive {self._speed}, please!"


# Examples:

truck1 = Truck()
print(truck1.start_engine('fast'))
# Ready to go! Drive fast, please!

truck2 = Truck()
print(truck1.start_engine('slow'))
# Ready to go! Drive slow, please!
