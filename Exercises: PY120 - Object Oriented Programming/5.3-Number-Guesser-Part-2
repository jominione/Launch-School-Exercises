# In the previoius exercise, you wrote a number guessing game that determines
# a secret number between 1 and 100, and gives the user 7 opportunities to
# guess the number.

# Update your solution to accept a low and high value when you create a 
# GuessingGame object, and use those values to compute a secret number for
# the game. You should also change the number of guesses allowed so the user
# can always win if she uses a good strategy. You can compute the number of
# guess with:

# import math

# number_of_guesses = int(math.log2(high - low + 1)) + 1
# "high" is the highest number in the range
# "low" is the lowest number in the range

# Note that a game object should start a new game with a new number to guess
# with each call to play.

# Solution:

import math, random
