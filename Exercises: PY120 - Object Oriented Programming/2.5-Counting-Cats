# Create a class named Cat that tracks the number of times a new Cat object
# is instantiated. The total numer of Cat instances should be printed when 
# total is invoked.

# Solution:

class Cat:

    counter = 0

    def __init__(self):
        Cat.counter += 1
    
    @classmethod
    def total(cls):
        print(Cat.counter)

# Examples:

Cat.total()

kitty1 = Cat()
Cat.total()

kitty2 = Cat()
Cat.total()

print(Cat())
Cat.total()
